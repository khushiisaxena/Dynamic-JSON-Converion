# Dynamic-JSON-Converion
JSON is a flexible data exchange format but can be complex, with deeply nested structures. Businesses often require JSON data in CSV for analysis, but manual conversion is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the process of converting nested JSON into structured CSV, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and efficiency.
