# Dynamic-JSON-Converion

## Overview
JSON is a widely used format for data exchange because of its flexibility and hierarchical structure. However, JSON can be complex, containing deeply nested and dynamically changing structures. Businesses often need JSON data in CSV format for analysis, reporting, and decision-making. Manual conversion is inefficient, requiring significant effort and technical knowledge. This project is an automated solution that converts nested JSON into structured CSV,ensuring data integrity, accuracy, and scalability.

The Dynamic JSON Parser is a powerful tool designed to parse multiple complex JSON files and convert them into a single, structured CSV output. It intelligently merges data based on nested keys, making it ideal for handling hierarchical or dynamic JSON structures.


## Key Features
- **Multiple File Parsing:** Supports batch processing of multiple JSON files simultaneously.
- **Dynamic Structure Handling:** Automatically adapts to nested or changing JSON structures.
- **Custom Merging:** Merges data based on user-defined or inferred nested keys.
- **CSV Output:** Generates a single, consolidated CSV file for easy analysis.
- **Dark-Themed Web Interface:** User-friendly interface with a sleek dark theme.

## Use Cases
- **Data Integration:** Flatten complex JSON data for ETL pipelines.
- **Data Validation:** Compare and validate data across multiple JSON sources.
- **Data Analysis:** Convert hierarchical JSON data to relational format for analytics.
