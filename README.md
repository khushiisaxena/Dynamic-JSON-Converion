# Dynamic-JSON-Converion
JSON is a widely used format for data exchange because of its flexibility and hierarchical structure. However, JSON can be complex, containing deeply nested and dynamically changing structures. Businesses often need JSON data in CSV format for analysis, reporting, and decision-making. Manual conversion is inefficient, requiring significant effort and technical knowledge. This project is an automated solution that converts nested JSON into structured CSV,ensuring data integrity, accuracy, and scalability.
